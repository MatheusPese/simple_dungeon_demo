## How to modify the dungeon
The Dungeon-Making process is pretty much modifying the already existing dungeon with the GridMap node - you can replace every Wall, Door and Key in this way. Just remember to change the size of the dungeon on the Root Script!

## To-do:
* ~~Fog effect, preferably using a shader.~~ As it works right now (v.2.1), the Fog Effect included on WorldEnvironment node is somewhat clunky to use, and there is little to none documentation about it. Instead, I used a OmniLight node on the player to create the visual limitation on the scene.
* ~~An automatic way to create the floor and the ceiling, without setting up the quad above and below the dungeon.~~

## Updates:
* 20/12/2016: Added OmniLight to player; Ceiling and Floor are now generated by script.
